# HireHub

HireHub is a modern web app that helps users track their job applications in one place. Instead of juggling spreadsheets or notes, users can save roles they are interested in, update their application status, and keep important details organized.

## What This Project Does

HireHub allows users to:

- Browse available job listings  
- Save jobs they want to apply for  
- Track application progress (Interested → Applied → Interview → Offer → Rejected)  
- Add notes like recruiter info, interview dates, or links  
- Remove applications when no longer relevant  

The goal was to build something simple, fast, and genuinely useful for students and job seekers.

## Why I Built This
